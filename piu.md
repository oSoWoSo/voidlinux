# piu (Platform Independant Updater)

<img align="right" alt="Skunk Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/piu/master/.readme-assets/logo/skunk-logo.png">

**`piu` makes cross-platform package management stink less.**

`piu` is an all-in-one wrapper for different package managers. It was
born out of frustration over constantly typing the wrong command or
passing the wrong flags when on different Linux distros.


### Features
* `piu` works the same across distros, no more memorising each package
  manager and its quirks
* Auto-update package repositories if they're old when installing or
  upgrading the system (no need for additional flags).
* Includes a built-in option to install locally downloaded packages,
  even when the standard package manager doesn't support that; such as
  `dpkg` vs. `apt`
* Print the number of updates available, suitable for use in a status
  bar or shell scripts
* `sudo` automatically if additional permissions are needed. *No more...*
```
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
```
* And most important: *less typing!* Compare `piu u` to `apt update && apt upgrade`

## Installation

```console
$ curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/piu/master/piu && sudo mv piu /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/piu
```
Alternatively, if you have something like `~/bin` setup, just download
`piu` there.

### Uninstall
```console
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/piu
```


### Optional `sudo` Setup
While not required, if you will be using `piu` in a status bar script
you should setup `sudo` to allow the package manager to sync its cache
without prompting for a password.

This will allow `piu` to automatically refresh the package manager's
cache periodically. Otherwise, `piu` will simply state the cache is
out-of-date.

Add the following to `/etc/sudoers`, depending on your distribution:

#### apt (Debian & Ubuntu)
```console
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt update
```

#### pacman (Arch Linux)
```console
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pacman -Sy
```

#### xbps (Void Linux)
```console
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/xbps-install -S
```

**NOTE**: updating the package cache is relatively innocuous and safe to
perform automatically without password; it does not install, update, or
replace any programs. Most package managers need additional permissions
simply because the cache is usually in `/var`, where most users don't
have write permission.
